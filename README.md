# Construction-Product-requirement-document
I have learned something and tried to create â€“ here is the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Construction site! ðŸ“„ 

This document showcases a comprehensive approach to modernizing construction site management, bringing together tools like augmented reality,
real-time motion tracking, and 3D annotations on Google's Project Tango tablet. Itâ€™s exciting to see how technology can simplify complex on-site tasks 
for contractors. Looking forward to exploring more in product development!
